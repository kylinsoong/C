== Networking

1. In routed mode, due to the full proxy architecture, there should be a connection between BIG-IP and backend server, why check from backend server, the source is Client, rather than Big-IP(`10.1.20.12:8081         10.1.10.199:10177`)?
2. Still in routed mode, the full proxy, there are 2 connections(Client to BIG-IP, BIG-IP to Server), how the infors exchanged between these two connections?
